# LangGraph Project Lab

A **project-based learning repository** for building and evolving **AI agents using LangGraph**.

This repository follows a **step-by-step project approach**, where each numbered folder represents a clear learning milestone in agent design, control flow, and system thinking.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Learn **LangGraph by building real projects**
- Understand agent **state, routing, looping, and termination**
- Practice designing **safe and reliable agent workflows**
- Move from simple agents to **production-style architectures**
- Develop strong fundamentals for agent-based systems

This is **not a tutorial repo**.  
This is **learning by building**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- One repository for structured learning
- Projects are **incremental and ordered**
- Each project focuses on **specific LangGraph concepts**
- Complexity increases gradually
- Clarity > cleverness


### Folder Convention

- **Numbered folders (`01`, `02`...)** show learning progression
- Each folder represents a **standalone LangGraph project**
- Earlier projects remain unchanged once completed
- New concepts are introduced only in newer projects

---

### `01_tool_calling_agent`
**Goal:** Build an agent that can think and act using tools  
**Focus:**
- LLM-driven tool selection
- Deterministic tool execution
- Agent → Tool → Agent looping
- State updates after tool calls
- Guarding against infinite loops

This project introduces **core LangGraph behavior** and represents
the transition from passive agents to **action-oriented agents**.

---

## 🧩 Project Rules

For every project in this repository:

- The graph logic must be explicit
- Tools must be deterministic
- Routing decisions must be explainable
- No hidden magic or shortcuts
- Each project should stand on its own

---

## 🚀 When to Create a New Repository

A project is moved into its **own repo** only when:

- It solves a single, clear problem
- It can be used independently
- It is stable and showcase-ready
- It no longer needs this lab structure

Until then, everything stays here.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- Async-first design
- State-driven agent architecture

---

## 📈 Status

🚧 Active learning  
📚 Focused on fundamentals  
🧪 Iterative and experimental  

---

## 🧠 Final Note

This repository reflects **how I approach agent systems**:

Agents are treated as:
- Systems, not scripts
- State machines, not chatbots
- Products in evolution, not demos
